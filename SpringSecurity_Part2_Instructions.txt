Spring Security Tutorial Part 2
"Implementing DAO Authentication Provider"
"Let's go back to the previous secured application using Basic configurations"

Steps:
1. Add database tables for Users and Roles
	- Let's populate some data while we create tables.
	- I'll be using MD5 for password protection
	- You can create User management module if you have time.
2. Add models for these tables
	- Let's make them Entities
	- I'm using ManyToMany mapping since Many users can have many roles and many roles can              	be assigned to many users.
3. Add DAO component for Users
4. Add UserDetailsService implementation class
	- this class will be used by Spring Security to pickup users and authenticate them internally.
5. Add configuration changes in security xml file
6. Test
	- Let's try adding some users and roles

*Notes
	- You can use many hashing algoriths to strengthen you password protections such as SHA with 
	with different levels
	- Having Users stored in database is a good thing to manage users.
